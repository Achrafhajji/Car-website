            <div class="card_text">
              <p>You may have your heart set on a specific car, but you won’t be able to take it home unless you can afford it. 
                Consider the monthly payment along with other vehicle ownership costs.
                A good rule of thumb is to spend no more than 20 percent of your monthly household income on a new car. 
                This figure should include your monthly car loan payments and all other expenses, like fuel, car insurance, maintenance, repairs and registration fees. 
                For the monthly payment alone, Edmunds suggests that you should aim for no more than 15 percent of your income.

              <p>Use Bankrate’s auto loan calculator to get an accurate estimate of what you can expect to pay each month and in interest over the life of 
                the loan. It’s equally important to check your credit as it will determine the interest rate you receive.

            <div class="card_text">
              <p>Do you want to drive the car as long as the wheels can stay on?
                 If so, buying is the way to go, and you’ll have the ability to trade or sell the vehicle when you want a fresh set of wheels.
                  However, if you want a new car every three years, consider leasing.
                Leasing means that you might get a more upscale car for your money as they often come with lower 
                down payment requirements and a more affordable monthly payment. But you won’t own the car outright, and you’ll need to look out 
                for specific lease terms, such as mileage restrictions and wear-and-tear fees, to avoid hefty penalties.
                <hr/>
              <p>Consider the vehicles on your radar and weigh the pros and cons of buying and leasing one of them. 
                Bankrate’s calculator can help you estimate potential cost savings of buying or leasing so you can make an informed decision.

            <h2 class="card_title">Research car options</h2>
            <div class="card_text">
              <p>Start researching your favorite vehicles to find the best car for you. First, 
                visit automaker websites and independent auto information sites to assess the features that are important to you.
                 Note MSRPs (manufacturer’s suggested retail prices) and invoice prices. 
                 Then check local inventory listings to see what is available in your area.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <p>Also research any possible discounts.
                 After all, who wants to pay more for a car than they have to?
                  Many automakers offer discounts to students, military members and even members of certain credit unions. 
                  These discounts can be stacked and combined with any cash-back rebates on the model, 
                  which should be deducted after you negotiate the price. Check the automaker’s website for these incentives before heading in.

            <div class="card_text">
              <p>The cost of car ownership is much more than just your initial payment. 
                Use websites like Edmunds or Kelley Blue Book to get a general idea of gas, insurance, repair and maintenance 
                costs in your area — though these numbers will depend on your driving habits.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <p>For even better accuracy, do your own calculation for fuel based on the number of miles you drive annually and get an auto
                 insurance quote on the cars you are considering.
                  You’ll need to give the insurance agent the exact model, trim level, engine and add-ons to get an accurate quote. 
                  It’s important to remember that fees, like sales tax, 
                  registration fees and documentation fees are not included on the sticker price advertised by dealers.

              <p>Don’t hesitate to ask for more time behind the wheel.

                 would be comfortable and if your regular cargo would fit well.

              <p>Once it’s time to sit down and talk about pricing, 
                come prepared with the research you’ve done. See if other dealerships are offering better deals on your vehicle 
                and seek a price match from your salesperson.
                If you’re looking to trade in your current car, save that discussion for after you negotiate the sale price of your new car. 
                Having those conversations separately will help you get a better deal on your current car, and you’ll fare even better 
                if you’ve done research on your current car’s value online.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <p>Before you sign the final contract, go over all the details carefully. 
                Examine any proposed fees and check that everything you negotiated verbally is also spelled out in writing. 
                You should also be prepared to say no to those nice-to-have extras that you might not need or to the entire deal 
                if it doesn’t work for you and the salesperson isn’t willing to budge. Check out these dealer options to skip.

              <p>By now, you should have a handful of potential cars that check out history-wise and fit within your budget.
                 But it’s not enough to be able to pay for the car—you’ll also need to make sure you can pay for the insurance that comes with it.
                Talk to your current insurance agent about running a few quotes for the cars you have in mind. 
                If the price is too steep, don’t be afraid to consult an independent agent for more options.
                Online insurance quote generators can be helpful, but you’ll get a better deal by talking 
                to an insurance agent on the phone or in person. You might even be eligible for discounts you didn’t know existed!

              <p>Remember, the purpose of a vehicle is to get you from point A to point B, not to prove your social status to the world.
                 As tempting as it is to hit the road in a car you can’t afford, it’s more likely to be a burden than a blessing—especially 
                 if it’s not in your budget.
                Chances are, your car isn’t the first thing you think about in the morning or when you go to bed at night. 
                The key to happiness is not a new car, so don’t pay for it like it is!
